              <p>An accomplished and precise senior software developer with a proven track record in crafting robust web applications across various development frameworks.
                    Armed with over 5 years of experience in translating complex business requirements into scalable, high-performance solutions, 
                    I am capable of leveraging a diverse ecosystem of web technologies to deliver exceptional user experiences. 
                    My passion for learning and all things science launched me into the realm of machine learning, 
                    where I am actively engaged in building innovative projects to enhance software capabilities and drive business outcomes. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy robotics and low-level IoT coding, 
                    particularly with Arduino, where I have contributed to projects involving sensor integration, data collection, 
                    and real-time control systems. I also enjoy 3D printing, and fusion360 for designing models. Lastly, you can find me outside riding my bike through the beautiful city of Portland Oregon.
