                <p>An accomplished and precise Senior Software Developer with a proven track record in crafting robust web applications across various development frameworks.
                    Armed with extensive experience in translating complex business requirements into scalable, high-performance solutions, 
                    I am adept at leveraging a diverse toolkit of web technologies to deliver exceptional user experiences. 
                    My dedication to continuous learning drives me to expand my expertise into the realm of machine learning, 
                    where I am actively engaged in building innovative projects to enhance product capabilities and drive business outcomes. 
                    Additionally, I possess a keen interest and hands-on experience in robotics and low-level IoT coding, 
                    particularly with Arduino, where I have contributed to projects involving sensor integration, data collection, 
                    and real-time control systems.
